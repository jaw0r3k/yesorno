# YesOrNo? Flutter App

A project that will make your choices easier
Just click a button to get a random answser

Made as a side fun hobby project, so you all have full allowance to make your life choices based on that app

> I dont know if it works on ios as i have no possibility to test that

## Quick lookaround

- Hold the randomize button if you want to open the settings to change the rate of getting yes

- Rest should be very straight forward i guess
